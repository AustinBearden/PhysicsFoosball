Using physics engine: https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js

I am going to build a ball motion calculator with the cannon.js physics engine.
I will be giving the calculator a point mass's starting x, y, and z position.
Its starting velocity, and starting xy and xz directions.
I will also give its time in motion.
The calculator will give its final x, y,
and z coordinates after the specified amount of time in motion.
