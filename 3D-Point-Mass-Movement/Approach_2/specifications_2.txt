We will be defining the movement of a ball.
For the ball, we will not be considering its size. The ball will just be a point with a specified mass.
The ball will be moving in 3D space.
We will specify the ball's x, y, and z-coordinates and its initial velocity. Then we will output specifics about
the balls position and speed at a specified time after it is released.

lets build a ball class
Should we have a movement class that uses a ball? Or just movement methods that are a part of the ball class.
Just movement methods that are part of the ball class
