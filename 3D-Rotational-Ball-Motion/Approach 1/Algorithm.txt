Physics:

      -> Angular displacement (theta):
      
         theta = theta sub naught + omega sub naught * time + (1/2) * alpha * time^2
      
      -> Angulare velocity (omega):
     
         omega = omega sub naught + alpha * time
         --or--
         omega^2 = omega sub naught ^2 + 2 * alpha *(theta - theta sub naught)
      
      -> Angular acceleration (alpha):
      
         alpha average = change in omega / change in time
      
      -> Kinetic energy of a rotating object:
          K = (1/2)*I*omega^2 where I is moment of inertia
          
      -> 
      

Are we going to assume that there is no skidding?? Sure

Non-slip conditions:

Build in the condition that speed equal to zero means the ball stops

Do we want to find out when friction takes out all energy from the ball?

--------------

We are not going to account for friction. We will simply assume non-slip conditions and then
allow the user to specify a set acceleration. We are ultimatly wanting to find final position
based on starting position, size of ball, speed, and acceleration. Thus, we will need to include
the conversion between the angular displacement, angular velcoity, and angular acceleration versus
the linear displacement, velocity, and acceleration respectively.
