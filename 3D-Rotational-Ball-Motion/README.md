This repository will extend the "3D-Point-Mass-Movement" repository and add the feature of rotational motion

(Releasing: Sunday, April 8th, 2018)

  Model the movement of a ball with no movement of the ball in the up and down position. Consider the point mass as we
  did in project 1. Also, consider rotational motion of the ball around its' own access.
  
      Approach 1: Write the program on my own in .js without help of a major physics engine library
      
      Approach 2: Write the program using the CANNON.js physics engine library

Physics:

      -> Angular displacement (theta):
      
         theta = theta sub naught + omega sub naught * time + (1/2) * alpha * time^2
      
      -> Angulare velocity (omega):
     
         omega = omega sub naught + alpha * time
         --or--
         omega^2 = omega sub naught ^2 + 2 * alpha *(theta - theta sub naught)
      
      -> Angular acceleration (alpha):
      
         alpha average = change in omega / change in time
      
      -> Kinetic energy of a rotating object:
          K = (1/2)*I*omega^2 where I is moment of inertia
          
      ->
