# PhysicsFoosball
Will keep track of my progress of particular components of my Physics engine for my virtual foosball game.

Project 1:

  Model the movement of a ball in 3D space. Tackle the problem twice. Each time with a different approach
   
     Approach 1: Write the program in .js and use a fullfledged physics engine to model the movements
     
     Approach 2: Write the program in .js but this time don't use any physics libraries,
     write the whole program yourself
